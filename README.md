## C++ Example Source Code

This repository contains simple self-contained examples demonstrating various aspects of using C++ *wrongly*.

I wrote these examples so I can generate example core dumps for my debugger. Use at your own risk.

Most examples will reliably hang or crash, the others have memory leaks.

The only exception is LibraryExample, I use that to demonstrate a problem that is impossible to reproduce.
